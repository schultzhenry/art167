          "A virtual pencil relies on the use metaphor of a real
          pencil, though the virtual pencil’s behaviors are quite
          different. For one thing, it can draw at a variety of
          widths with pixel-precision and make ruler-straight
          lines with a crosshair instead of a pencil lead. These
          abilities are beyond those of a real pencil in the
          physical world.<br />
          As graphical user interface (GUI) pioneer Alan Kay explains,
          <em>The screen as “paper to be marked on” is a metaphor
          that suggests pencils, brushes, typewriting. Fine, as far
          as it goes. But it is the magic —understandable magic—that
          really counts. Should we transfer the paper metaphor so
          perfectly that the screen is as hard as paper to erase and
          change? Clearly not. If it is to be like magical paper, then
          it is the magical part that is all-important and that
          must be most strongly attended to in the user interface
          design.</em>" <strong>Giampetro</strong>

          What if we had methods for customizing the level a tool
          simulates the metaphor for which it is named? Adjustments
          already exist for visual preferences, or accessibility,
          but what might the following look like if we took their
          names more literally?

          "A language consisting of graphic symbols that could be
          understood anywhere on the planet was the dream of many
          leading designers of the modernist movement in the last
          century. In the 1970s, American industrial designer Henry
          Dreyfuss published an exhaustive 'dictionary' of graphic
          symbols that he had collected and codified by meaning and
          categorized by use. The belief was that these could be
          the bases of a universal means of communication, the
          prelude to a more generalized way of communicating, seen
          by some as liberating humanity from the straitjacket of
          specialization. However, this was before the actual
          practice of globalization superseded the assumptions and
          boundaries of modernist universality, when the dream
          began to die along with many of the purist tenets of the
          movement. Maybe it is just hibernating while the media—the
          Internet, mobile communications and computing, satellite
          positioning and navigation—catch up.

          Why didn't Dreyfuss' vision catch on? Is it possible Emojis
          are approximating what he envisioned?
