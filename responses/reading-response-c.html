          These tokens seem to suggest how even
          in a world without written words a
          kind of typography would emerge.
          Idiosyncratic typologies and
          topologies, strange sets in ranges of
          size, offered as language and/or
          currency: types of metals, shades of
          green, sources of energy, ice-cream,
          stones, butterflies, clouds, false
          moustaches, ways of walking. A
          typography that re-imagines he
          quality of our relationship to the
          things around us by being of those
          things. (My Typographies, p. 61)
